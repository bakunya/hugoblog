*Before starting, please be sure that you have
[installed Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-1-install-hugo) and

In your Hugo site `themes` directory, run:

Or, if you don't plan to make any significant changes, but want to track and update the theme, you can add it as a git
submodule via the following command:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/zuramai/hugoblog
```

Next, open `config.toml` in the base of the Hugo site and ensure the theme option is set to `hugoblog`:

```
theme = "hugoblog"
```
